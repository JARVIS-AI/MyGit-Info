# MyGit-Info
My Github account Inforamtion | About Repositories, About Projects, About Relases, Software, Organizations and ...



## Introduction

I make this repo itself for show the information about my repos 😀

Although there is a description in each repo for say what's it for, but I make it gather all here and explation them.

I think this must be rule someday in Git CVP ( Controll Version Programmes )😎

So If you have any problem with knowing about repos maye you find your answer here.😘



## Clarification

1. So of my repos are forked, maybe edited or just for archiving in my space to use it and make it myself
2. If any of repos I have make a conflic with you, just contact me and we will talk 😇
3. In some repo I make a release software, NONE OF THEM ARE VIRUS EVER NEVER 🤯
4. Some codes I published have license even some markdown files and tips and explanations so use them in that way please 🙏💋
5. I dont have any clarify for now.
